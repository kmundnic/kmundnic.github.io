I'm currently an Applied Scientist at Amazon.

Earlier this year, I completed my PhD in the [Signal Analysis and Interpretation Lab](https://sail.usc.edu/) (SAIL), University of Southern California (USC).

My interests lie between machine learning and behavior. During my PhD, my focus was on behavioral aspects of human-centered machine learning, where I studied:

 - The behavior of annotators during the task of labeling subjective constructs (such as those found in psychology or affective computing) and subsequently proposed novel annotation collection as well as annotation fusion methods,
 - The use of wearable and non-wearable sensors to predict affective and behavioral states in a workplace setting.

Outside of work, I enjoy backpacking, cycling, skiing, and [photography](https://www.500px.com/kmundnic) (mostly street and landscape).
