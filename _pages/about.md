I'm an Applied Scientist at Amazon.

I completed my PhD at the [Signal Analysis and Interpretation Lab](https://sail.usc.edu/) (SAIL), University of Southern California (USC).

My interests lie between machine learning and behavior. During my PhD, my focus was on behavioral aspects of human-centered machine learning, where I studied:

 - The behavior of annotators during the task of labeling subjective constructs (such as those found in psychology or affective computing) and subsequently proposed novel annotation collection and annotation fusion methods,
 - The use of wearable and non-wearable sensors to predict affective and behavioral states in a workplace setting.

Outside of work, I enjoy backpacking, cycling, skiing, and [photography](https://www.500px.com/kmundnic).
